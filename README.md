# CCN_RSA_UoB  
Using Python, implement the basic RSA key generation algorithm introduced during the lectures. Accepting values for p and q as inputs from the user, your code must generate and display all the key variables (p, q, n, e, d and z) being used to derive the keys, alongside the keys themselves, allowing them to be checked and validated. You should assume p and q are prime numbers in the range 500 - 1000. Your code should demonstrate the keys generated are valid by encrypting the following text:
